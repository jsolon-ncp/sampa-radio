Recruitment

Fecal Sample Collection
1. Across cohorts, fecal samples were collected from 77-95% of recruited individuals from 5 cohorts and from 37% from the DIVIDS cohort.  
2. Within each cohort, the rates of fecal sample collection was similar by nutritional status.

Lipase and Trypsin 
1.  Lipase was analysed only for DIVIDS.
2. Trypsinogen was analysed for all those with CT Scan images

Amylase
1.  Amylase was analysed for samples in the entire study.
2.  Across cohorts, describe 
3.  Within cohorts, by evermal

Imaging 
1.  Describe number of images per cohort
2.  Cicada has a lower proportion of ultrasounds compared to other cohorts

Subset for Analysis.
1.   Of the 2297 subjects recruited into the study, 1911 had fecal elastase assays.  Of these, 90 had to be dropped from further analysis because of standard curve inconsistencies.  Of the 1,821 with elastase assay, 1439 had ultrasound measurements and of these,  257 had CT Scans.  

Results EPI [an_bivariate_assays.do]
1. No significant differences in the presence of EPI or levels of EPI between malnutrition groups.
2. For reference:  33% with EPI;  15% with mild/moderate ; and 18% with severe
3. There are significant differences in EPI and levels of EPI across cohort.
4.  The African cohorts have higher rates of EPI than the Asian cohorts.
