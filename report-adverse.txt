**SOP 17 Definitions**  
*Diabetes*   

Diabetes in SAMPA is defined as **plasma glucose ≥ 11.1 mmol/L at 2 hours** in a standard oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). All participants identified as having diabetes will be re-tested to confirm this and will also be tested for the presence of urinary ketones. Those found to have diabetes on re-testing will be referred to local clinical services together with their SAMPA OGTT results.

*Hypertension* 

Hypertension in adults = systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg on two occasions with the participant at rest.   
Hypertension in children = two measurements of systolic or diastolic blood pressure greater than the 95th percentile for age, sex and height (SOP 10 which is from Table 1, Sinaiko, Hypertension in children. NEJM 1996; 335: 1968).
